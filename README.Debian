For building a debian package just type

./bootstrap

./debian/rules binary

Note:

the name libOpenTracker.so for the library is against debian naming conventions.
Change the following in /usr/bin/dpkg_gencontrol.


  } elsif (m/^-p(.*)/) {
    $oppackage= $1;
    #&error("Illegal package name \`$1'");
  } elsif (m/^-c/) {
