LEGOROBOT commands
------------------

- motorState `abc`
   possible values for motors a,b,c:
    + = turn motor on
    - = turn motor off
    0 = release motor (turn off but let it run freely)
    * = leave it as it was before

  e.g. motorState `+*-` turns motor A on, motor C off and leaves motor B alone

- motorDir `abc`
   possible values for motors a,b,c:
    f = set motor direction to forward
    b = set motor direction to backward
    * = = leave it as it was before

   e.g. motorState `fb*` sets motor A forwards, motor B backwards and leaves motor C alone

- setSensor `123`
   possible values for sensors 1,2,3
    l = light sensor (value is [0-100]%)
    t = touch sensor (value is [0|1])
    r = raw sensor (value is [0-1023])
    c = temperature sensor
    o = rotation sensor
    * = leave it as it was before

   e.g. setSensor `l*t` sets sensor 1 to light mode, sensor 3 to touch mode and leaves sensor 2 as it was before

- sensorValue x
   possible values for param. x
    1 = set legorobot.response to the current value of sensor 1
    2 = set legorobot.response to the current value of sensor 2
    3 = set legorobot.response to the current value of sensor 3

   e.g. sensorValue 2 retrieves the value of sensor 2

- wait x
   wait for x milliseconds

- sound x
   play sound type #x (0<=x<=5)

- off
   switches the RCX off
