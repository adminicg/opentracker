Faust Setup in the IMS VR Lab

The basic setup is a two user AR workspace with two HMDs, two pens and two pips.
These are tracked by a ascension flock of birds with 6 stations connected to
a dedicated Linux tracking host. In addition to that another ARToolkit based
optical tracking host may track a set of markers used to manipulate and start
applications.

faustWallTracker.xml is the common OpenTracker file for the Studierstube client.

faustUser1.iv and faustHMD1.iv contain the UserKit and Camera file for the first user.

faustUser2.iv and faustHMD2.iv contain the UserKit and Camera file for the second user.

Four different configurations can be started using the provided batch files :

* single first or second user
* dual user without markers
* dual user with markers
