Dear collegue,

thank you very much for your interest in Studierstube.

The Studierstube software is distributed under GPL. Specially mind the
following part of the license:

 "This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
  GNU General Public License for more details."

Having said, you are welcome to download and use this software. However,
we guarantee no level of support. This is research software that is
under constant development by a group of time pressed people. It is not
simple to setup, configure or use. And while we try to help you with any
serious problems, you will be mostly on your own using it.

Download

We provide yearly snapshots of the Studierstube software and any support
libraries as precompiled packages for Windows. You can download these
packages from the following location:

http://www.studierstube.org/download/cd/

Use stb / faust to access the webpage.

The packages are named stbcd-X.X.zip where X.X is the version number.
Only use the last one as we do not support earlier versions at all.
Follow the install instructions in the index.html web page in the
package.

Subversion

The primary source for the Studierstube software is a Subversion
repository. Please, consult the following page for details on how to
access the repository. Access to this page is restricted, use stb /
faust to access it.

http://www.studierstube.org/internal/

You can use the download package from above as a start and then update
the software via Subversion as the necessary repository information is
stored in the package.

Documentation

For general documentation on using and programming Studierstube, go to
the developers' page on the Studierstube web page. The same information
is also part of the download package and linked from the index.html.
