<h1>
The workspace user-interface:</h1>

<hr>
<h2>
Introduction:</h2>
The workspace user-interface provides means for application- and window-handling
within the Studierstube-environment.
<br>It uses the Studierstube interaction-devices PEN and PIP (see Studierstube-introduction)
<br>and virtual interaction-elements displayed on the PIP (mostly virtual
3D-buttons).
<br>To highlight an element just position the PEN's tip within the element's
geometry (actually its bounding-box).
<br>The element's color should turn yellow, to indicate that it is highlighted.
<br>To trigger a virtual button, highlight it and press the primary button
of the PEN and release it again.The virtual button should turn red and
its geometry
<br>changes, to indicate that it is currently pressed.
<p>In the following description of the virtual interaction-elements "pressing
a button" stands for the actions needed to press a virtual button.
<h2>
The elements of the workspace user-interface:</h2>

<h3>
The system-bar:</h3>
current-task button: shows the currently focussed application, switches
on/off the task-bar when pressed
<p>exit button: stops the currently focussed application and all its contexts
(if it is a context-application)
<br>it also exits the workspace, if the focussed application is either
the clipboard or the application-loader application.
<p>new-context button: creates a new context for the currently focussed
application (only available for context-applications)
<p>delete-context button: deletes the currently focussed context (only
available for context-applications)
<h3>
The task-bar:</h3>
The task-bar shows all running applications, each having its own button,
identified by the icon-texture of the associated application. To switch
to an application (i.e. to switch to its pip-sheet and focus its window)
just press the corresponding button. If the application has multiple contexts,
a pulldown-menue will be shown, when the corresponding task-bar button
is highlighted. To switch to one of the shown contexts, press the corresponding
pulldown-button, or press the main task-bar button to switch to the first
context in the pulldown-list.
<br>The currently active task (and/or context) is marked by a special color
of its task-bar button (default green).
<h3>
The window-bar:</h3>
The window-bar provides manipulation widgets for the currently focussed
window.
<br>Each button is textured accordingly to its current functionality, which
depends on the current state of the window
<br>(e.g.: if the window is minimized, the minimze button becomes a restore
button).
<p>minimize button:
<p>&nbsp; if the window is not minimized: minimizes the window
<p>&nbsp; if the window is minimized: restores the window
<br>&nbsp;
<p>maximize button:
<p>&nbsp; if the window is not maximized: maximizes the window
<p>&nbsp; if the window is maximized: restores the window
<br>&nbsp;
<p>border on/off button:
<p>&nbsp;turns on the border of the window
<p>&nbsp; turns off the border of the window
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Application-handling:</h2>

<h3>
Starting applications/new contexts:</h3>
Workspace-applications are started using the application-loader.
<p>The application-loader has three PIP-sheets.
<br>To switch to a sheet just press one of the sheet-selector buttons.
<p>The first sheet contains all context applications: just press the corresponding
button to start an application. (note: if the application is already running,
a new context is created for this application).
<br>The second sheet contains all old-style (legacy) applications (non-context):
just press the corresponding button to start an application. (note: legacy
applications should only be started once).
<br>The third sheet contains a filebrowser. The filter of the filebrowser
is set to display only workspace-applications.
<br>Browse through the directories by pressing the corresponding buttons
(directories are displayed green).
<br>To start an application press the browser-button labeled with the name
of the application.
<p>To create a new context for an already running application, press the
new-context button on the systme-bar.
<h3>
Switching applications:</h3>
There are two ways to switch to a specifc application/context:
<p>1. Focus the window of the application/context by moving the PEN into
the window and clicking the primary PEN-button.
<br>2. Use the task-bar.
<h3>
Stopping applications:</h3>
To stop a specific application, it has to be focussed (see "switching applications").
<br>If it is focussed, just press the exit button on the system-bar to
stop the whole application and all its contexts.
<br>To delete only one context, press the delete-context button on the
system-bar.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Window-handling:</h2>
Use the window-bar to minimze, maximize and restore the window. Also for
toggling the border of the window on and off.
<br>To move and/or rotate the window, highlight its border, press and hold
the primary PEN-button and drag the window until it is in the desired position,
then release the PEN-button.
<br>To change the size of the window, highlight a corner of the window,
press and hold the primary PEN-button and move the PEN until the size fits
your needs, then release the PEN-button.
