<font size=+3>Known Bugs, Caveats and Workarounds</font></h1>

<p><br><font size=+3>Workarounds:</font>
<p><font size=+2>Dual Mode - using both HMDs under Windows NT with Oxygen
GFX420:</font>
<p>Both HMDs can only be addressed with the 3dLabs Oxygen GFX420 under
Windows NT. There is still no dual stereo driver support for Windows 2000.
<br>In order to run the Studierstube under NT it must be fully recompiled.
<p>The other problem is related to QT. In connection with OpenSource Inventor
it is not possible to open 2 QT stereo windows/widgets which are resized
later on. Therefore the workaround is to initialize both windows with the
correct window size without resizing them later on. Gerd Hesina fixed a
bug in soqt.lib which uses predefined environment variables to set both
windows with the correct size. You must set these 2 environemt variables
in Windows NT:
<br>SOQT_DEFAULT_X_SIZE
<br>SOQT_DEFAULT_Y_SIZE
<br>For the Glasstrons we use SOQT_DEFAULT_X_SIZE = 800, SOQT_DEFAULT_Y_SIZE
= 600. If only one is set it is supposed that the other one has the same
value. If none is set, then the windows will have a default size of 500x390.
In the last case, if your xsize and ysize variables in the SoDisplayKit
(in your UserKit) differ from the default settings, a resize of the windows
will be done, which will lead to the earlier described problems.
<br>The "hacked" soqt.lib (where Gerd included the use of those environment
variables) can be downloaded here (<a href="soqt_fix.zip">soqt_fix.zip</a>).
The modified sources as well as compiled lib and dll are included in the
ZIP file. Maybe Gerd finds some time to make them available via the webpage
of the <a href="http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/hostings/openinventor/">OpenSource
Inventor project</a> soon. You can get all modifications by contacting
Hannes Kaufmann at <a href="mailto:kaufmann@ims.tuwien.ac.at">kaufmann@ims.tuwien.ac.at</a>
too.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>Font problems with OS OIV:</font>
<p>Gerd fixed a bug in libFL which is distrubuted with Gerd's SGI OpenInventor
Windows port. LibFL is used as a font library but due to a bug it was impossible
to set a specific size with SoFont for SoText2. The font size was 32 by
default and couldn't be changed. This is fixed now. Other font styles can
be used as well (SoFontStyle).
<p>The new version of the libFL source can be downloaded here (<a href="libFL.zip">libFL.zip</a>).
If Gerd finds some time to generate precompiled binaries, they will be
made available on the <a href="http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/hostings/openinventor/">OpenInventor
Website</a>.
<br>Follow these steps to compile inventor yourself with the new libFL:
<br>delete inventor\misc\libFL
<br>extract zip archive into inventor\misc\libFL
<br>to compile inventor it is sufficient to do:
<br>vcvars32.bat
<br>del install\lib\inventor.dll
<br>build_all.bat
<p>If you want to use the SoFontStyle you have to set the Font names correctly
(the default names expected by Inventor can be seen in SoFontStyle.cxx)
e.g.:
<br>for family SERIF (or NONE)
<br>copy winnt\fonts\times.ttf winnt\fonts\Utopia-Regular
<br>copy winnt\fonts\timesi.ttf winnt\fonts\Utopia-Italic
<br>copy winnt\fonts\timesbd.ttf winnt\fonts\Utopia-Bold
<br>copy winnt\fonts\timesbi.ttf winnt\fonts\Utopia-BoldItalic
<p>for family TYPEWRITER
<br>copy winnt\fonts\cour.ttf winnt\fonts\Courier
<br>copy winnt\fonts\couri.ttf winnt\fonts\Courier-Oblique
<br>copy winnt\fonts\courbd.ttf winnt\fonts\Courier-Bold
<br>copy winnt\fonts\courbi.ttf winnt\fonts\Courier-BoldOblique
<p>for family SANS the default names are
<br>Helvetica
<br>Helvetica-Oblique
<br>Helvetica-Bold
<br>Helvetica-BoldOblique
<br>&nbsp;

<br><font size=+3>Known bugs:</font>
<p><font size=+2>2001-07-04 jp: Opening unicast connection fails:</font>
<p><i>Note:</i> This may not be a bug, I'm documenting this just for the case
anyone experiences the same problems. Later I have found that my current STB
version has been linked against <code>ws2_32.lib</code> instead of
<code>wsock32.lib</code>. This could have been the cause of the witnessed
behaviour.  
<p><i>Symptoms:</i> When trying to connect to a tracker that sends tracker
data directly to the computer where studierstube runs (that is, it uses a UDP
unicast and not a multicast group), I have experienced a problem where
Studierstube was not able to receive any data - select() returned always 0 to
signal a timeout.
<p><i>Solution:</i> Chage the code in <code>multicast.cxx</code> to call
<code>connect()</code> in
<code>createMulticastSocket()</code> only for MULTICAST sockets. 
<p><font size=+2>2001-06-12 hk: Pip Texture Loading problem:</font>
<p>When starting an application for 2 users in FieldSequentialDisplayMode
(with flexible tracker) on the same machine (in distributed studierstube),
all application buttons on the PIP of the first user have the same textures
on them (the last one that has been loaded) and the same goes for all buttons
of the pipsheets - they all have the same texture (of the last button in
the row). This goes for all applications (tested with Construct3d, Modeller
and Roentgen). When touching the buttons with the pen, the correct textures
are loaded/displayed.<br>
The second user has the application selection menu on his PIP instead of
the buttons of the running application - this is due to the distribution
and not a bug.<br>
This whole problem is probably due to a driver problem under WinNT with
our Oxygen GFX420. No other reason can be identified - it only happens
in 2 user mode and 2 user mode (on the same machine) only works under NT.
<p>[This is no bug: When starting in 2 user mode in MonoDisplayMode (with
keyboard tracker, screen output) the first user has application buttons
on his PIP *and* the application selection menu (buttons overlap) - I think
the application buttons have the correct texture, the selection menu textures
are a bit wrong. The second user gets the same buttons as the first user.&nbsp;<br>
The reason is that both PIPs overlap - that's why we are seeing both menus.]
<p><font size=+2>2001-03-01 hk:</font>
<p>SoQt hangs when trying to set size of a 2nd stereo widgets with Studierstube
on an Oxygen 420 graphics card. Workaround provided by gh: use desired
default size (800x600 for Glasstron) directly in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SoQt.
See Workaround "Dual Mode - using both HMDs under Windows NT"

<p>An SoLOD inside an SoDragKit crashes the application when 3D events
are fed into the SoDragKit
