New in Studierstube 3.1 (2003-01-28):
* Coin3d compliant code.
* unified SoGUI architecture for different Coin3d GUI bindings.
  (SoQt, SoGtk, SoXt, SoWin)
* SoQt specific code now works with the current SoQt by Coin3d and the
  Qt 3.0 library.
* improved unix build system. now based on autotools.
* a lot of cleanup work.
* Daniel Wagner's md2 quake model loader nodekit.
  *coolness factor guaranteed* ;)
