HOW TO RUN CONSTRUCT3D WITH ACIS + SPEECH SUPPORT:
==================================================

Install ACIS (we have an university license for our institute and can use it free
of charge for educational purposes (teaching+research)). You can find the latest 
version of ACIS on our studierstube internal download page or in the internal 
shared directory on mozart/shared/software/Windows/Apps/Math/ACIS
ACIS is available for nearly all platforms (Win, Linux, Mac, IRIX, HP UNIX, Solaris)
Currently (September 2003) we are using ACIS Release 12 but we are updating to new
versions as soon as they are released.

After having run the ACIS setup you must set 2 environment variables:
A3DT=C:\ACIS (your installation directory of ACIS)
ARCH=NT_DLL  (the lib directory - depending on your operating system)

In addition set the PATH to your lib directory e.g.
PATH=%PATH%C:\ACIS\LIB\NT_DLL (which is also $A3DT$\LIB\$ARCH$)

For Speech support:
First install the Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 from 
http://www.microsoft.com/speech/download/SDK51/

Compile Opentracker with Speech support, compile Studierstube and Construct3D and
run bin/apps/construct3d/run_c3d.bat

For SGI_OS_OIV (this is not the case for COIN):
When compiling Construct3D you will get an error within the ACIS include file ...\base\baseutil\base.hxx in the lines 78 and 79. There are 2 type definitions
    typedef signed int intptr_t;
    typedef unsigned int uintptr_t;
These types are also defined in OpenSource Inventor, therefore we get a redefinition 
error. Just comment both lines and recompile. Everything should work now.
//    typedef signed int intptr_t;
//    typedef unsigned int uintptr_t;


Have fun!
