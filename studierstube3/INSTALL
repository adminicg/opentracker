Install and Build Instructions
==============================

This file contains the build instructions for Studierstube.

Studierstube uses GNU autoconf, automake and libtool for the configuration
and compilation under operating systems like Linux and SGI Irix. Visual C++
project files are provided for Win32.

Before you can build Studierstube you will need the following packages set
up on your system:

Required packages:
------------------
o SoQt, SoGtk, SoXt or SoWin - http://www.coin3d.org/
  (check out the most recent version from cvs)

o Coin - http://www.coin3d.org/
  (check out the most recent version from cvs)
  or
  SGI Open Inventor - http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/

o OpenTracker - http://www.studierstube.org/opentracker/
  (check out the most recent version from cvs)

o Xerces - http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html
  (needed for OpenTracker)

o ACE (The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment) -
  http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html
  (download the latest beta kit)

Optional packages:
------------------
o ARToolkit - http://www.hitl.washington.edu/research/shared_space/download/
  (get the most recent version and configure OpenTracker with ARToolkit to
   make it available in StudierStube)

o libccvt - http://www.gvu.gatech.edu/ccg/resources/usbstuff/code.html
  (to use video background under Linux with USB cams without using ARToolkit
   in OpenTracker)


Studierstube has a different philosophy regarding the installation of the
package than you are probably used to under other packages. You do not
install it with 'make install' into your system. Instead the Studierstube
source tree represents your work tree at the same time. The workspace
binary gets installed under studierstube/bin/workspace/.

To build the Studierstube stbapi library you have to issue a 'make' in the
Studierstube root directory. For tools or apps you descend in the
corresponding directories.  E.g., to build sman2 you would do the
following: 'cd tools/sman2; make'. To build all apps you need to do this:
'cd bin/apps; make'. To just build the animal app: 'cd bin/apps/animal;
make'.


Configuration Options
=====================

The configure script in the Studierstube root directory provides the following
options:

--help

  Specifying this option will cause configure to list all its command
  line options and exit.

--enable-div

  Specifying this option will cause configure to enable Distributed Inventor.
  You will need to patch your Inventor library to be able to use it at the
  moment. Patches can be found at http://www.studierstube.org/div/.
  It's enabled by default. To disable it specify --disable-div.

--enable-libccvt

  Specifying this option will cause configure to enable the use of libccvt
  which is a library that provides USB camera access under Linux. Use this if
  you don't want to use the ARToolkit video code within OpenTracker. Copy the
  libccvt.so library to a place where Studierstube can find it, e.g. 
  $(STUDIERSTUBEPATH)/lib.
  It's not enabled by default.

--with-ace=DIR

  With this option, you can specify where the ACE root directory resides.
  A typical usage would be: --with-ace=../ACE_wrappers.

--with-opentracker=DIR

  With this option, you can specify prefix to where OpenTracker go installed
  if it is not a default one. Usually not needed.

--with-soqt
--with-sogtk
--with-soxt

  Specify one of these options to tell configure which SoGui binding you want
  to use. If you don't provide one of this options they will get probed one
  after the other until one is found.

CPPFLAGS="<string>"
CFLAGS="<string>"
CXXFLAGS="<string>"
LDFLAGS="<string>"
LIBS="<string>"

  If you need to add command line flags to respectively the source code
  preprocessor, the C compiler, the C++ compiler, and the linker, invoke
  configure with an argument like one of the above.

    ./configure CFLAGS="-ansi -pedantic" CXXFLAGS="-ansi -pedantic" [...]

  This would cause compilation of both C and C++ files to be done with
  the "-ansi" and "-pedantic" options.

  You can also override other things like which compiler is used by
  setting $CC, $CXX, $LD, $AR and $RANLIB amongst other variables.


Example Usage
=============

Assuming that Studierstube resides in /scratch/studierstube/studierstube/
and libraries like OpenTracker, ACE, ARToolkit and Xerces reside in
/scratch/studierstube/, and soqt-config and coin can be found by your
linker you would go on and issue the following:

./configure --with-ace=../ACE_wrappers/

To disable the usage of the Distributed Inventor and to specify another SoGui
binding issue this:

./configure --with-ace=../ACE_wrappers/ --disable-div --with-soxt
