This is the IMGR library used for gesture recognition by the SoGestureKit.
It was written by Oliver Bimber, Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics, Rostock, Germany.

This directory is not compiled, only included by other files.

Inclusion can be disabled by commenting out "#define GRT_IMGR" in stbapi/misc/GRT_defs.h.
This removes the dependency on the IMGR library.
