in docs/install.html. For detailed information about building, integrating
and extending OpenTracker, please visit the web site at

OpenTracker was compiled and tested on Windows2000 and Windows98, 
SGI Irix (6.5.x only), and Linux (SUSE 7.0). It should work on similar 
platforms but might require some small porting changes.

Many thanks to Dieter Schmalstieg, Toni Fuhrmann, Gerd Hesina, Jan Prikryl, 
Hannes Kaufmann, Ivan Viola and Matej Mlejnek for comments and code. 
And also InterSense for their tracker code.
