Currently we only have a version for Windows, tested on Windows2000 and
Windows98, and Irix, tested on Irix 6.5.x only. We plan to make a
Linux version too.

Many thanks to Dieter Schmalstieg, Toni Fuhrmann, Jan Prikryl, Hannes Kaufmann,
Ivan Viola and Matej Mlejnek for commends and code. And also InterSense for
their tracker code.
