<h2> 1 - Project Description<a name="project_description" id="project_description"></a></h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to get a natural input device for use in a mobile 
  studierstube environment. Further it was necessary to get button inputs from 
  the iPAQ and transfer them to studierstube, and there was the task to design 
  sort of a ray picker for the input device that works together with studierstube.<br>
</p>
<h4> Tracking Details</h4>
<p> Tracking is archived by marking the object with an ARToolKit marker. ARToolKit 
  detects the marker in the video stream and studierstube generates an object 
  overlay to the iPAQ. In series a natural tracking for the iPAQ will be developed.<br>
</p>
<h4> Button input details</h4>
<p> Button inputs are catched by a little java application running on the iPAQ. 
  They are sent via the java application over bluetooth to a java server running 
  on the notebook, which transfers them directly to studierstube.<br>
</p>
<h4>Raypick Action details</h4>
<p> This class implements a ray picker that shoots a ray either from the tracked 
  station or from the camera, and gives information about the picked object. For 
  detailed information about using this nodeKit see the task descriptions for 
  the VRLU2002 on the page <a href="http://www.ims.tuwien.ac.at/%7Ereitmayr/notes/vrluprojects2002.html">http://www.ims.tuwien.ac.at/~reitmayr/notes/vrluprojects2002.html</a>. 
  <br>
  The class is inherited from SoStationKit and registers an event callback method 
  in its constructor. This callback-method is called in the method SoStationKit::handle3DEvent() 
  after a preprocessing task. In the callback, the station's position and orientation 
  is used (in POSE mode) for transforming the ray-geometry (&quot;content&quot; 
  field) and for making a SoRayPickAction (SoRayPicker::performRayPickAction()). 
  The action's resulting parameters are reflected in the SoRayPicker's output 
  fields. The length of the ray is scaled depending on the distance of <br>
  the picked point by measuring the size of the ray-geometry with a SoGetBoundingBoxAction 
  and computing an appropriate scale factor with that the geometry reaches the 
  needed size. Note that the position of the tracked station is expected as world-coordinates, 
  the current implementation uses this position without changes in the RayPickAction. 
  The default direction (without rotation) of the station is expected to (0,1,0), 
  that means, the geometry of the ray is scaled and positioned along the world's 
  Y axis. In STICK-mode, the computed length of the <br>
  ray-geometry is reused and no RayPickAction is performed while the station's 
  button is pressed. For using the SoRayPicker, a contextKit-wrapper class was 
  created <br>
  (SoRayTest) which loads the SoRayPicker module.<br>
  This SoRayTest class can be used in an IV file as contextKit, so no recompilation 
  of the whole Studierstube is needed.<br>

<h2>4 - Bluetooth-Connection Setup<a name="bluetooth_connection_setup"></a></h2>
<p>This paragraph describes the steps that are necessary to get the serial connection 
  between iPAQ and the studierstube mobile setup (notebook), and the Java Application 
  that catches and the cursor buttons input from and transfers them to studierstube.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3>establishing the serial connection</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Notebook:</strong> Start the bluetooth connection manager. (Luftgeist: 
    <code>C:\Programme\3Com\Bluetooth\BTCM.exe</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>iPAQ:</strong> Activate bluetooth: 
    <ol>
      <li>Click the blue Symbol on the right lower corner of the display. A context 
        menu appeares.</li>
      <li>Select <em>start Radio</em>. The blue LED on the left upper side of 
        the iPAQ starts flashing.</li>
      <li>Start the Bluetooth Manager (at <em>Start-&gt;Bluetooth Manager</em>). 
        The Bluethooth-Manager shows you all activated Bluettoh-Devices currently 
        in range.</li>
      <li>Select the desired device, e.g. <em>Luftgeist</em>. A window showing 
        device information appeares.</li>
      <li>From the menu <em>Actions</em> select the entry <em>esatblish connection 
        to serial port</em>. When the connection is established, a confirmation 
        message appeares in the lower part of the window.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>starting the data forwarding application</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Notebook:</strong> Start the java-application <em>ConnectionListener</em> 
    <p>Click the conjunction <em>ConnectionListener @ COM5</em> on the desktop. 
      If you want to start the application yourself, enter the following command:</p>
    <p><code>java ConnectionListener COM &lt;COM-Port&gt;</code></p>
    <p><em>COM-Port</em> is the name of the serial Interface, e.g. <em>COM5</em></p>
    <p>A window appears, showing the transmitted characters in text form. It is 
      ment for debugging purposes only. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>iPAQ:</strong> Start the Java-Application <em>startInputCatcher</em>. 
    Use the conjunction <em>COM8ButtonInputCatcher</em> found under<em> Start-&gt;Programme</em>. 
    A window appears, showing the pressed buttons in clear text.<em> Important:</em> 
    This window needs to keep the focus, otherwise no data is transmitted.</li>
</ol>
<strong>The connection is now established. Events are generated by pressing and 
releasing the cursor buttons on the iPAQ, transferred via bluetooth and sent from 
ConnectionListener to the multicast-socket with the address 224.100.200.101, where 
OpenTracker receives the ButtonState-Packets.</strong> 
<h2><br>
  5 - Demo Program Description<a name="demo_program_description"></a></h2>
<p>When you start the example demo file, you see a sphere about a meter away from 
  you. The iPAQ creates a beam that starts at the front of the iPAQ and points 
  in the direction of the iPAQ length axis. When you move the iPAQ, it is tracked 
  and the beam moves. This action is called ray tracking. When the beam enters 
  the sphere, the length of the ray is shortened to the distance between iPAQ 
  and object. When you press the button now, the sphere changes its color and 
  you now can move the sphere by moving the tracking device (the iPAQ). When you 
  release the button, the sphere is released from the ray and remains in its new 
  position.</p>
