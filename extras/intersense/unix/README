This directory contains the driver software supplied by InterSense
for the IS-300,600,900 series trackers.

No changes have been made except that the type definition in the file isense.h
of type BOOL was renamed to IS_BOOL to avoid a name conflict with 
/usr/include/X11/Xmd.h used in studierstube.h.

The file main.c is an example program and is not used within the StbVt.
